# Mitchel Bot

My first discord bot. Using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

A discord application made in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## Setup

Create a Clash Royale token [here](https://developer.clashroyale.com/#/)

Create a Twitter developer account to get Twitter's api. [Here](https://developer.twitter.com/apps)

Download the [ImageMagick library](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows)

Create a .env file with this structure:
```env
discord_token=DISCORDTOKEN
clash_royale_token=CLASHTOKEN
twitter_consumer_key=TWITTERKEY
twitter_consumer_secret=TWITTERSECRET
```

## Note
This is my first discord bot project, first project posted on GitHub, and a personal project so some commands
are specific for the server that my friends and I are in. If you want to use this discord bot
for yourself I recommend changing the parts in main.py where I have comments.

If you have any questions feel free to DM 24andMe#3014 on discord.
