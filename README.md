#Mitchel Bot

My first discord bot. Using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

A discord application made in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## Setup
Create a .env file with this structure:
```env
discord_token=TOKENHERE
clash_royale_token=CLASHTOKENHERE
```

## Note
This is my first discord bot project and a personal project so some commands
are specific for the server that my friends and I are in. If you want to use this discord bot
for yourself I recommend changing the parts in main.py where I have comments.

If you have any questions feel free to DM 24andMe#3014 on discord.
